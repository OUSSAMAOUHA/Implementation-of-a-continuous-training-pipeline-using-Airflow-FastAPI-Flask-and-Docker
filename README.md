pip install pycaret
pip install xgboost
```


## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OUSSAMAOUHA/Implementation-of-a-continuous-training-pipeline-using-Apache-Airflow-and-Streamlit.git
    cd projetDiabetes
    ```
    once you're there, you can see the project structure perfectly.
